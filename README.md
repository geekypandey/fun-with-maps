# Fun With Maps

A web-application to play games on the map, such as guessing the capital, currency etc.
A fun project to learn about geography of the world.


### Inspiration
I am fondly interested in learning the capitals of all the countries and learning some facts about them.
Also I am interested in learning about the history of the country, particularly countries in Europe.
`Fun fact: I have memorized all the countries and their capitals of Europe.`
To further enhance and make it more interactive I have decided to built this web application.


### Installation
Download the repository and move into it.
Create virtual environment and install the requirements and then
run the application using `flask run`. It would start a development server on the machine.
```console
$ git clone https://github.com/geekypandey/fun-with-maps.git
$ cd  fun-with-maps
$ virtualenv -p3 venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ flask run
```
